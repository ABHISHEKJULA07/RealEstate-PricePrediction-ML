#  RealEstate Price Predictor using ML & EDA

This project is a machine learning-based solution to **predict real estate prices** based on key features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and more. It covers the full pipeline — from **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to **model building and evaluation** — using real-world housing data from Hyderabad and Bengaluru.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📊 Performed detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns and relationships.
- 🧹 Cleaned and processed **90,000+ property listings** with Pandas and NumPy.
- 🧠 Built ML models including **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.
- 🔍 **Feature selection and correlation analysis** to improve model accuracy.
- 📈 Evaluated models using **R² Score**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and visualization plots.
